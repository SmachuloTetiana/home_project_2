    	<p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. </br>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. </br>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing </br>Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/">lorem ipsum</a></p>

    	<big><em>It is a long established fact</em> <wbr>that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.</big>
    	<small>Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</small><wbr>
    	<mark>The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using <strong>'Content here, content here'</strong></mark>
